# üåü DocuMerge for LLMs üåü

üöÄ **Easily prepare GitHub repositories for AI LLM analysis!**

Are you trying to train an LLM to analyze a GitHub repository or similar? Instead of manually extracting every single file and organizing it into a document, let **DocuMerge for LLMs** do the heavy lifting for you! This Python script consolidates all files in a repository into **two output files** that are perfect for LLM analysis.

This Python script transforms an entire GitHub repository into a single text file optimized for LLM training, while simultaneously generating a compact "insights" file containing structured analysis of the codebase. The dual-output approach ensures you can train your LLM model on complete code contents (when possible), but still leverage the smaller summary file when token limits are exceeded.

## üß† What Does It Do?

The **DocuMerge for LLMs** script performs the following tasks:

1. **Merges All Files**: Combines all files in the repository (including subfolders) into a single `.txt` file, with each file separated by its name as a section header.
2. **Generates Insights**: Creates a second, smaller `.txt` file that provides a detailed overview of the repository, including:
   - **Technologies and Dependencies**: Lists libraries and frameworks used in the codebase.
   - **Directory Structure**: Provides a tree-like view of the repository's organization.
   - **Key Files and Their Roles**: Summarizes important files and their comments or docstrings.
   - **Code Statistics**: Counts lines of code and file sizes for each file.
   - **Largest Files by Lines of Code**: Identifies the largest files in the repository.
   - **Functions and Classes**: Extracts all functions and classes from Python files.
   - **Keywords**: Highlights frequently used terms in the codebase.
   - **Language Distribution**: Breaks down the repository by programming language and shows the contribution of each language.
   - **README Summary**: Summarizes the content of the `README.md` file (if available).
   - **Issues**: Logs any errors encountered during processing.

## ‚ú® Why Use DocuMerge for LLMs?

- **Save Time**: No need to manually extract and organize files.
- **Simplify Analysis**: Provide LLMs with a single, well-organized `.txt` file and a concise insights file.
- **Improve Workflow**: Focus on training and analyzing, not file management.

- **Comprehensive Insights**: The second file provides a detailed breakdown of the repository, making it easier for LLMs to understand the codebase. When you speak to your LLM about what you are tryign to do with the Analysis File attached to it, you can tell it what you are tryign to do and then it can know all the files from that, and then on the first file that is made, it will paste all the code into that text file, your LLM can help you locate which pieces of that first large file code that it was to see (or you can navigate through Github easily and copy that way), but this is a very efficient way for your LLM to know what it should suggest to you in regards to what files of code it needs to see while you are upgrading an existing public repo or working on your own

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use It (Step-by-Step)

1. **Download the Repository**:
   - Clone or download the GitHub repository you want to analyze.
   - Unzip the folder if it‚Äôs a `.zip` file.

2. **Download the Script**:
   - Save the `documerge_for_llms.py`
     
3. **Run the Script**:
   - Double click the documerge_for_llms.py and it will bring up
   - The Script uses a Graphical User Interface which will allow you to select the Github Repo you wish to run it on. 

4. **Wait for the Magic**:
   - The script will process the repository and generate **two output files**:
     - `LLM-DocuMerge_<RepoName>.txt`: A large file containing all the repository files.
     - `LLM-DocuMerge-Insights_<RepoName>.txt`: A smaller file with detailed insights about the repository.

5. üìú Output Files

### 1. **LLM-DocuMerge_<RepoName>.txt**
This file contains all the files in the repository, separated by their names. 


### 2. **LLM-DocuMerge-Insights_<RepoName>.txt**
This file provides a detailed overview of the repository.

3. **Technologies and Dependencies**: Extracts `import` and `require` statements to identify libraries and frameworks used.
4. **Directory Structure**: Generates a tree-like view of the repository.
5. **Key Files and Comments**: Extracts comments and docstrings from Python files.
6. **Code Statistics**: Counts lines of code and file sizes for each file.
7. **Largest Files**: Identifies the largest files by lines of code.
8. **Functions and Classes**: Extracts all functions and classes from Python files.
9. **Keywords**: Highlights frequently used terms in the codebase.
10. **Language Distribution**: Breaks down the repository by programming language.
11. **README Summary**: Summarizes the content of the `README.md` file (if available).
12. **Error Handling**: Logs any issues encountered during processing.
