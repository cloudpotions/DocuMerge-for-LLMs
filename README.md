# üåü DocuMerge for LLMs üåü ~ By Jesse Ellis with CloudPotions.com - Director of Corporate Development - BPO Seats, the largest seat leasing and office Provider in the Phillipines - Message hello@bposeats.com if you are interested in outsourcing, AI Consultancy by yours truly, or any Tech Stacks

In summary, this Python script  consolidates a Github repository into one text file to train an LLM model, and also generates a comprehensive analysis of the codebase in a structured insights file. This allows training an LLM on the contents and high-level structure/characteristics of the repository.

# üåü DocuMerge for LLMs üåü

üöÄ **Easily prepare GitHub repositories for AI LLM analysis!**

Are you trying to train an LLM to analyze a GitHub repository or similar? Instead of manually extracting every single file and organizing it into a document, let **DocuMerge for LLMs** do the heavy lifting for you! This Python script consolidates all files in a repository into **two output files** that are perfect for LLM analysis.

## üß† What Does It Do?

The **DocuMerge for LLMs** script performs the following tasks:

1. **Merges All Files**: Combines all files in the repository (including subfolders) into a single `.txt` file, with each file separated by its name as a section header.
2. **Generates Insights**: Creates a second, smaller `.txt` file that provides a detailed overview of the repository, including:
   - **Technologies and Dependencies**: Lists libraries and frameworks used in the codebase.
   - **Directory Structure**: Provides a tree-like view of the repository's organization.
   - **Key Files and Their Roles**: Summarizes important files and their comments or docstrings.
   - **Code Statistics**: Counts lines of code and file sizes for each file.
   - **Largest Files by Lines of Code**: Identifies the largest files in the repository.
   - **Functions and Classes**: Extracts all functions and classes from Python files.
   - **Keywords**: Highlights frequently used terms in the codebase.
   - **Language Distribution**: Breaks down the repository by programming language and shows the contribution of each language.
   - **README Summary**: Summarizes the content of the `README.md` file (if available).
   - **Issues**: Logs any errors encountered during processing.

## ‚ú® Why Use DocuMerge for LLMs?

- **Save Time**: No need to manually extract and organize files.
- **Simplify Analysis**: Provide LLMs with a single, well-organized `.txt` file and a concise insights file.
- **Improve Workflow**: Focus on training and analyzing, not file management.
- **Comprehensive Insights**: The second file provides a detailed breakdown of the repository, making it easier for LLMs to understand the codebase.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use It (Step-by-Step)

1. **Download the Repository**:
   - Clone or download the GitHub repository you want to analyze.
   - Unzip the folder if it‚Äôs a `.zip` file.

2. **Download the Script**:
   - Save the `documerge_for_llms.py` script into the root folder of the repository you just downloaded.

3. **Run the Script**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the folder where the repository and script are located.
   - Run the script using Python:
     ```bash
     python documerge_for_llms.py
     ```

4. **Wait for the Magic**:
   - The script will process the repository and generate **two output files**:
     - `LLM-DocuMerge_<RepoName>.txt`: A large file containing all the repository files.
     - `LLM-DocuMerge-Insights_<RepoName>.txt`: A smaller file with detailed insights about the repository.

5. **Use the Output Files**:
   - Use the output files to train an LLM to understand, modify, or improve the repository.

## üìú Example Output Files

### 1. **LLM-DocuMerge_<RepoName>.txt**
This file contains all the files in the repository, separated by their names. For example:


### 2. **LLM-DocuMerge-Insights_<RepoName>.txt**
This file provides a detailed overview of the repository. For example:

## üéâ Features of the Script

1. **Handles Folders and Subfolders**: Automatically traverses the entire directory structure.
2. **Organized Output**: Each file's content is labeled with its name for clarity.
3. **Technologies and Dependencies**: Extracts `import` and `require` statements to identify libraries and frameworks used.
4. **Directory Structure**: Generates a tree-like view of the repository.
5. **Key Files and Comments**: Extracts comments and docstrings from Python files.
6. **Code Statistics**: Counts lines of code and file sizes for each file.
7. **Largest Files**: Identifies the largest files by lines of code.
8. **Functions and Classes**: Extracts all functions and classes from Python files.
9. **Keywords**: Highlights frequently used terms in the codebase.
10. **Language Distribution**: Breaks down the repository by programming language.
11. **README Summary**: Summarizes the content of the `README.md` file (if available).
12. **Error Handling**: Logs any issues encountered during processing.
