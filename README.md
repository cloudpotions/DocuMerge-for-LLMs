# üí≠üß™  DocuMerge for LLMs 

 **Easily prepare GitHub repositories for AI LLM analysis!**

Are you trying to train an LLM to analyze a GitHub repository or similar? Instead of manually extracting every single file and organizing it into a document, let **DocuMerge for LLMs** do the heavy lifting for you! This Python script consolidates all files in a repository into **two output files** that are perfect for LLM analysis.

This Python script transforms an entire GitHub repository into a single text file optimized for LLM training, while simultaneously generating a compact "insights" file containing structured analysis of the codebase. The dual-output approach ensures you can train your LLM model on complete code contents (when possible), but still leverage the smaller summary file when token limits are exceeded.

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What Does It Do?

The **DocuMerge for LLMs** script performs the following tasks:

1. **Merges All Files**: Combines all files in the repository (including subfolders) into a single `.txt` file, with each file separated by its name as a section header.
2. **Generates Insights**: Creates a second, smaller `.txt` file that provides a detailed overview of the repository, including:
   - **Technologies and Dependencies**: Lists libraries and frameworks used in the codebase.
   - **Directory Structure**: Provides a tree-like view of the repository's organization.
   - **Key Files and Their Roles**: Summarizes important files and their comments or docstrings.
   - **Code Statistics**: Counts lines of code and file sizes for each file.
   - **Largest Files by Lines of Code**: Identifies the largest files in the repository.
   - **Functions and Classes**: Extracts all functions and classes from Python files.
   - **Keywords**: Highlights frequently used terms in the codebase.
   - **Language Distribution**: Breaks down the repository by programming language and shows the contribution of each language.
   - **README Summary**: Summarizes the content of the `README.md` file (if available).
   - **Issues**: Logs any errors encountered during processing.

## ‚öóÔ∏è  Why Use DocuMerge for LLMs?

- **Save Time**: No need to manually extract and organize files.
- **Simplify Analysis**: Provide LLMs with a single, well-organized `.txt` file and a concise insights file.
- **Improve Workflow**: Focus on training and analyzing, not file management.

Repository Intelligence for LLMs: DocuMerge creates two powerful files that transform how AI assistants help with your code. The insights file provides a comprehensive map of your repository structure, enabling LLMs to instantly understand your codebase organization without requiring token-heavy analysis. When paired with the complete code file, your LLM can precisely identify which files need modification for specific tasks, guiding you through unfamiliar codebases or helping optimize your own projects. Simply share these files with any AI assistant to receive targeted development guidance and codebase navigation that's tailored to your repository's unique structure and patterns.

## ü™Ñ How to Use It (Step-by-Step)

1. **Download the Repository**:
   - Clone or download the GitHub repository you want to analyze.
   - Unzip the folder if it‚Äôs a `.zip` file.

2. **Download the Script**:
   - Save the `documerge_for_llms.py`
     
3. **Run the Script**:
   - Double click the documerge_for_llms.py and it will bring open a Graphical User Interface (works on Windows, Linux and IOS), which will allow you to select the Github Repo you wish to run the python script on. 

4. **Wait for the Magic**:
   - The script will process the repository and generate **two output files**:
     - `LLM-DocuMerge_<RepoName>.txt`: A large file containing all the repository files.
     - `LLM-DocuMerge-Insights_<RepoName>.txt`: A smaller file with detailed insights about the repository.

5. üìú Output Files

### 1. **LLM-DocuMerge_<RepoName>.txt**
This file contains all the files in the repository, separated by their names. 

### 2. **LLM-DocuMerge-Insights_<RepoName>.txt**
This file provides a detailed overview of the repository.
